## PASS Data
- The Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) is a data set established in 2007 by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) among German households.
- The dataset contains information at the household and individual levels.
- Households are identified via ‘hnr’ and ‘wave’
- Individuals are identified via ‘pnr’ and ‘wave’
- Access to the PASS main dataset is only possible via an application to the Research Data Center (FDZ).

## PASS-CF Data
- PASS Campus file dataset is a simplified version of the main dataset that is suitable for academic teaching and obtaining various insights into the handling of PASS data.
- Compared to the main dataset, PASS-CF contains a reduced number of observations, range of variables and modified identification numbers as well as information; therefore it is not suitable for substantial scientific analysis.

## Motivation for the Project
- The purpose of this project is to create a PASS-CF data preparation repository that can be a template and a starting point for a similar repository for the main PASS data set.
- We also aim to familiarize ourselves with the effective use of programming in cleaning panel data sets and performing initial analysis.
